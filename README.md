In the pop-up window that appears, paste your link in the __Website__ box and click __Save Changes__. *At this point, you will need to save any content you may have written in the edit field if you want or need to keep it.

1. To make things easier for __*Future*__ _You_, Click the __Commit Changes__ button early and often. Even with the original addition of content, try to make small additions or changes.
1. The more code or content you have, the longer it can take for GitHub to render. It may take as long as ten minutes sometimes, so, be patient.
